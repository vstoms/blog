Defender for Endpoint extends support to also include the Windows Server operating system. This support provides advanced attack detection and investigation capabilities seamlessly through the Microsoft 365 Defender console. 

Support for Windows Server provides deeper insight into server activities, coverage for kernel and memory attack detection, and enables response actions.

The previous implementation of onboarding Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 required the use of Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA).

The new unified solution package makes it easier to onboard servers by removing dependencies and installation steps. In addition, this unified solution package comes with the following major improvements:

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus with Next-generation protection for Windows Server 2012 R2
- Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules
- Network Protection
- Controlled Folder Access
- Potentially Unwanted Application (PUA) blocking
- Improved detection capabilities
- Expanded response capabilities on devices and files
- EDR in Block Mode
- Live Response
- Automated Investigation and Response (AIR)
- Tamper Protection
