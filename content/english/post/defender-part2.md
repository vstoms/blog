![Defender for Server](/images/Defender.png "Defender for Server")

Welcome to part two of the mini-series about Microsoft Defender for Server. Last time we talked a little about licenses that you need to get onboarded with MDFS.

**An update regarding the licenses for servers only, Microsoft will remove the options to buy licenses from CSP and you will only be able to get the licenses from Microsoft Defender for Cloud.**
